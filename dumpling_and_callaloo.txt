Callalloo
Wash and clean the callaloo by removing any older leaves or spots that you may find. 
Put the callaloo in a pot of clold water. Add salt and let it sit for an hour.
Wash again in cold water then chop into ¾ inch pieces.
Add oil and ¼ cup of water to a large pot.
PUt the fire to medium then add the callaloo.
Now is the time to add the chopped up seassonings such as the onions, tomatos, garlic, schotch bonnet pepper, and salt if needed.
Cover the pot and cook for ten minutes or untill the stalks of the callaloo are tender.

FOR THE DUMPLINGS
Mixx the flour, baking powder, butter and salt in a bowl.
Add water 1 tablespoon at a time until you can form the dough into a firm ball.
Set the fire to medium under a skillet with oil. 
Break small handfulls of the dough off and form them into a somewhat pattie shape.
One way to do this is to form the piece into a small ball then flatten it into a patty.
Please each newly formed piece of dough into the skillet and fry each side untill brown.
Remove once both sides are brown(not burned) and let it dry(from the oil).
Serve callaloo and dumpling together in a plate.
